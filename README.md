## Intro
Use this repository as a resource to help you better understand Redux state - State is important to track the actions that a user makes to your application. 

## Blog post related to this github repository
I've made a few changes but otherwise this is the same from the article: 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/redux-for-beginners/

## Resources outside of this one
Check out these resources to read up on State and how to incorporate it into a project

## Clone the repository
To use this repository: 
1. Clone this repository using either the HTTPS or SSH link (Depending on how you set up git)
Below is the HTTPS link, if you're using SSH it will look different
`git clone https://github.com/STEM-ENRG/DOM_events.git`

2. The files are know adding to the current directory. Now, change directories so that you are in the newly cloned git repository
`cd redux_state`

3. Open the folder/directory in VSCode

4. In the VSCode terminal: Since we have a package.json file that includes dependencies needed in order to run this project run this command to install those:
`npm install`

Move on to the next steps to see how you'll run this program - It's different that we've seen from our typical HTML and CSS programs

## How to run this program

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

-------
From here you can practice with different things you've learned. I encourage you to add in `console.log()` statements in the index.js file to get a better understanding of what the code is doing and gain a better understanding of state
